			<p><b>The FIRST STEP</b> is the removal of all your vent covers or registers. These are cleaned and later sanitized.</p>
			<p><b>SECONDLY</b>, each duct is cleaned from the vent opening all the way to the air handling unit using a "source removal" cleaning method. We use a high pressure air hose and compressor in conjunction with a commercial air duct cleaning vacuum with a HEPA filter. The system is put under a negative pressure using the vacuum and then the air hose is worked through the system to agitate the dirt which is then pulled out of the system by the constant vacuum. The returns are cleaned in the same manner. The THIRD STEP is the cleaning of the air handling unit (s). This includes cleaning of the blower, fan, motor and filter (s) areas.</p>
			<br>
			<p><b>The LAST STEP</b> is the application of an EPA registered sanitizer. The entire system is sanitized using an atomizing fogger. We use a hypo-allergenic sanitizer called Enviro-Con which eliminates microscopic organisms that can cause respiratory problems and odors.</p>
			<p>
				To help maintain a cleaner, healthier environment, we recommend using a high quality filter such as an ASHRAE tested electrostatic filter and run the fan on your unit as much as possible in order to constantly filter the air in the home. Most disposable filters only filter out 5%-7% of dust and pollen whereas an electrostatic filter removes 77%.
			</p>
			<p>
				Cleaning of the ducts improves the air quality in your home due to the removal of pollen, mold spores, mildew, bacteria and dust from the system. You may also notice that you are dusting less often and that your system operates more efficiently.
			</p>
			<p>
				We are a family business and guarantee all of our work.  If you have any questions or would like to arrange an appointment then please contact us at 281-352-1794.
